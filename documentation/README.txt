- Debugging, Debugging, Debugging. More that likley there are a good amount of bugs. Try to make simple unit tests to see if everything works. 
- Go into client-alpha branch and adapt code so that it'll connect with the server. There were some weird things that I read about diffeculties in connecting without chrome socket. If needed use that API.
